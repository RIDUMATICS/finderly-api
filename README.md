# Finderly API
Design a RESTful API which can collect the information on the different locations for us and also determine the distance between the locations and a configurable location which can be changed or supplied. The formula for calculating distance between two points can be gotten here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance.
